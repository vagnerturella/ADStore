            <h2>What happens after I order?</h2><br/>
            <p class="about">Once you have placed your order, the magic begins!
                <br/><br/>
                First, you will receive a confirmation email with your order number ( starting with #1... )
                <br/><br/>
                You will then receive a shipping confirmation email, meaning your parcel has been shipped and is on its way! This email may be followed by emails from our shipping subsidiaries, who will notify you as the parcel moves closer and closer to its destination.
                <br/><br/>
                Please note: Orders are dispatched within 2 business day of being placed. If there is any sort of issue and we cannot fulfil, we will notify you.

                - Check your address on your order confirmation, to make sure the correct house number, street, postcode were included. If there was a slight error in your address, please check at that address for your parcel.

                - If your parcel has been delivered to a place of work, university accommodation or an apartment block, please check with reception and all members of staff on duty when your parcel was signed for.

            <h2>How do I wash my jeans? </h2><br/>
            <p class="about">Usually we recommend not to wash your jeans for along as you can until you have no choice but to wash them!
                Set your washing machine to the gentle our delicate cycle. To keep your jeans looking the same way they did when you purchased them, wash the jeans on a gentle cycle. This reduces the wear and tear on your jeans, allowing the colours and design to stay intact.Fill the washing machine with cold water. Never wash the jeans in hot water. Lukewarm water can also be used when washing your Jeans. Hot water can cause colour loss in jeans, especially darker jeans.Turn your jeans inside out. Washing jeans can be abrasive to fabrics. Not only do clothes rub agaisnt one another, but the detergent, along with zippers, buttons, and snaps, can be damaging to the colour and fabric.Put your jeans in the washing machine with only other jeans or on its own. One of the major factors to consider while washing jeans is the bleeding of the indigo. Washing too often can make your jeans lose their colour or pre-fade. Line dry the jeans. Do not tumble your jeans in a dryer. Avoid over drying your jeans to prevent shrinkage and the  loss of colour to the fabric. If you want too dry your jeans in a dryer for time, tumble them on a delicate cycle with low heat. Take them out while still slightly damp and let them fully finish drying on a rack or a line.
